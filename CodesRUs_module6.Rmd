## Introduction
The ability to maintain constant internal temperature is a crucial skill for birds and mammals. Our brain and neural network only function at the ideal temperature range. (@morrison2019central) However, all mammals engage in some types of heterothermy, either regional or temporal, to modulate the metabolic demand or better survive in certain environments.(@mitchell2002adaptive) In this module, we use EDT 11  sensor to measure the change of temperature in the human body during day and night time to find the relationship between temperature difference and body mass. Also, we use downloaded data to find the relationship between temperature difference and body across different mammals.  To analyze these relationships, we create linear models based on the temperature measurement and body mass by ggplot in R-studio. 

## Methods
To collect body temperature in the subject of our team, a simple temperature recording data-acquisition system (DAQ) is assembled using an Elegoo Arduino clone and DHT11 sensor; 15 minutes of axial temperature reading was recorded in daytime and early in the morning respectively. To evaluate scaling relationship between mean temperature difference and mass within human subjects, we filtered out outlying data and constructed a linear model using ggplot. To analyze inter-specific relationship, we combined human data with 51 non-human mammals data and applied the same linear model.

## Results

## Discussions

Our results show that there is no apparent relationship between body temperature difference and mass within human subjects. This would be an allometric growth relationship as the change in mass does not equal the change in the difference in mean temperatures. There is a slight downward trend, in the data; meaning as mass increases, the difference in mean temperatures slightly decreases. The data helps to demonstrate that there are stable mechanisms controlling heat loss in humans and these appear to be for the most part consistent across individual human subjects as mass does not greatly differ. Within a small range of masses, we have similar metabolic rates further demonstrating the stability of human body temperature.


When the human data is combined with other mammalian data, a negative scaling between mean body temperature difference and mass was found. While not a perfectly isometric relationship since the changes in the magnitude of mass and temperature are not directly equal, it is far closer than that of the data consisting of only humans. As the mass of the mammal increases, the difference between the mean temperatures decreases as well. This demonstrates that the control of temperature oscillations does in fact vary across different mammalian species.

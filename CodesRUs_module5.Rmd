### Intro



### Methods 
To assess the effect of physical activity on body temperature, axillary temperature readings before and after a period of physical activity were recorded from all four group members using a DHT11 sensor connected to Arduino (fig.1). For each member, body temperatures at inactive states and after 5 minutes of jumping jack were recorded for 100 seconds. Each member’s mean temperature was plotted with +/- 1 standard deviation, and differences between each members’ temperature changes were compared. 

### Discussion


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Intro
As human being, we always have the physiological capacity to maintain stable body temperature under various conditions. If our body temperature becomes too high or too low, the hypothalamus in the brain will trigger corresponding thermoregulatory defense, such as sweating and shivering. Since thermoregulatory defenses are very effective in most conditions, body temperature rarely changes more than a few tenths of a degree from the ideal body temperature (@king1961energy). The purpose of this investigation is to measure the change of body temperature with different activity levels and how this change in different people. We use the DHT11 sensor to measure the variance of body temperature and apply ggplot in R-studio to visualize our data. 

### Methods 
To assess the effect of physical activity on body temperature, axillary temperature readings before and after a period of physical activity were recorded from all four group members using a DHT11 sensor connected to Arduino (fig.1). For each member, body temperatures at inactive states and after 5 minutes of jumping jack were recorded for 100 seconds. Each member’s mean temperature was plotted with +/- 1 standard deviation, and differences between each members’ temperature changes were compared. 

### Discussion
Following the previous research, during exercise, 80% of energy consumption is converted into heat and only 20% of energy consumption is used by muscle contraction. Our body temperature will increase due to the release of heat energy(@nagashima2012exercise). However, we did not see an increase in temperature from three out of the four group members(Tony, Amanda, and Steven). Only Nick’s body temperature increased after jumping jack. The finding is inconsistent with the previous research. One possible explanation is that we put the sensor on our clothes when we measured the data, which caused the error in our data.
